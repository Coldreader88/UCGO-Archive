# UCGO Tools
Above you'll find a couple of directories containing tools for UCGO. In reality there's just the one tool, UCGOZLIB, between both folders. Basically there's two different versions of the tool, one is made for working with files for the Official Client and the other is made for working with files for the Unofficial Client. Much like the server, the code for these tools has been left untouched how I found them. 

Instructions on what exactly these tools do and how to use them can be found in the 'src/ucgozlib/UCGOZLIB.java' file in each application.
