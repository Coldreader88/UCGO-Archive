# UCGO Docs
Above you'll find a couple of directories with miscellaneous documents and notes for UCGO. I'll be honest, there's all of piss poor organization going on in here but I'm sure with enough reading you can figure out how it all fits together. It's not terribly difficult.

#### External Documents

A handy dandy guide on quickly setting up the server was produced by a user named KJ16609 and can be found on google drives [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/195PYCamKjuBg1AVIy684ORKGKgkjwveO5Q28geXQyxE/edit). It doesn't cover everything but It's pretty good and should allow you to get up and running with minimal difficulty. It also has a nice listing of admin commands that you might find useful.
