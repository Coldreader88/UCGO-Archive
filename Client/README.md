# UCGO Clients
Above you'll find a copy of two of two UCGO Game Clients and a Config folder. 

The two game clients can be divided up into either Official or Unofficial, which is exactly how I've divided them; real original aren't I? Anyway, the official client is, from my understanding, an unmodified original client for the game and presumably the final published version. The unofficial client is a modified client published for use connecting to the https://ucgoserver.com/ private server back when it was still operational. I'm unsure of the *exact* difference between clients but chances are you'll want to use the unofficial one. You can find more information on these differences and how you can use each one in other parts of this repository.

Next, the Config folder has a basic config file inside it. Basically in order to tell the client where the server is you will have to update that config file with your own domain and have it all pointing to your server. How exactly that works will be covered elsewhere in this repository.

To be honest I'm not entirely sure how legal it is to be distributing these game clients. On one hand this is a game that closed down in 2007 and in the past it was hardly uncommon for websites to have mirrors of game clients you could just download for popular MMORPGs. On the other hand I'm not a lawyer and I don't know how this stuff works.
