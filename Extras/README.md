# UCGO Extras
Wasn't sure where to put this as this file falls was an individual that could be downloaded separately from the main server source code. Basically, there are two versions of this file 'xortable.dat'. There's the one in this directory and a second in the server directory. Though they are named the same and are the same size they are different. 

The file existing in the server directory is intended to be used with the server when the unofficial client is being used to connect to it. The one in this directory is intended to be used with the when when an official client is being used to connect to it. The file should be swapped out depending on which client you wish to use.

More information on this will be provided in the docs section of the repository.
